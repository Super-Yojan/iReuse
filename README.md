# iReuse

A webapp that let's you upload a picture of things that you don't use or want to 
throw away, and gives you a lit of things that you can do with it, and if you don't find
anything useful, give it to people who wants it. 

This will help lower the waste and make Earth a Better place.

# How it works?

* It works using a image classifier that takes in a picture that you upload and 
and returns what the image is.
* There's a crawler that crawls the internet to find ways to reuse old items, and indexes it based on the time, and money it takes to reuse it.
* Then it displays the result to the user based on that weight.

# Why?

* We have places like ebay and facebook marketplace to sell old stuffs, but this app
is more focused on allowing you to reuse, and collab with others.
